# Markowitz-Portfolio-Optimization-Risk-Return-Analysis-in-Python
This project implements the Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory to optimize a two-asset portfolio (S&amp;P 500 and bonds) by maximizing expected returns for a given level of risk. It demonstrates skills in financial modeling, data analysis, and Python programming, with a focus on diversification and risk-adjusted performance.
